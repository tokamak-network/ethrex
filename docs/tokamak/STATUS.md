## Tier S Features

### Feature #9: JIT-Compiled EVM (~92%)

**Completed:**
- revmc/LLVM backend integration (Phases 2-8)
- Tiered execution (counter threshold -> compile -> execute)
- Multi-fork support (cache key includes Fork)
- Background async compilation (CompilerThreadPool — multi-worker, G-5)
- LRU cache eviction
- CALL/CREATE suspend/resume
- Dual-execution validation (JIT vs interpreter)
- Benchmarking infrastructure + initial results
- Bytecode size limit graceful fallback (D-2) — negative cache + early size gate + interpreter-only bench results
- Constant folding optimizer (D-3 + G-7) — PUSH+PUSH+OP → single PUSH, 22 opcodes (6 original + 14 binary + 2 unary), 76 tests
- 76 LEVM JIT tests + 27 tokamak-jit tests passing (104 total)
- Arena-based LLVM memory lifecycle (G-1) — eliminates `mem::forget` memory leak, 178 tests pass
- CALL/CREATE dual-execution validation (G-3) — removed `has_external_calls` guard, validation runs for all bytecodes, 5 tests
- Parallel compilation thread pool (G-5) — crossbeam-channel multi-consumer, N workers (default num_cpus/2), deduplication guard, 4 new tests
- Constant folding enhancement (G-7) — expanded to 22 opcodes (DIV/SDIV/MOD/SMOD/EXP/SIGNEXTEND/LT/GT/SLT/SGT/EQ/SHL/SHR/SAR + NOT/ISZERO unary), refactored eval helpers, 68 unit + 8 integration tests
- JIT-to-JIT direct dispatch (G-4) — VM-layer fast dispatch for child CALL bytecodes, cache lookup + direct JIT execution, recursive suspend/resume, configurable + metrics, 10 tests
- LRU cache eviction (G-6) — replaced FIFO with AtomicU64-based LRU timestamps, lock-free get() hot path, O(n) eviction scan on insert(), 9 cache unit + 5 integration tests
- Precompile JIT acceleration (G-8) — `precompile_fast_dispatches` metric in JitMetrics, `enable_precompile_fast_dispatch` config toggle, metric tracking in `handle_jit_subcall()` precompile path, 9 tests (5 interpreter + 4 JIT differential)
- Recursive CALL runtime optimization (D-1 v1.1) — 3-tier optimization: (1) bytecode zero-copy caching via `Arc<Bytes>` in CompiledCode, (2) thread-local resume state pool (16-entry cap), (3) TX-scoped bytecode cache in VM (`FxHashMap<H256, Code>`), 11 tests (69 total tokamak-jit)

**Remaining:**
- Tiered optimization (profile-guided optimization)
- Production deployment

### Feature #10: Continuous Benchmarking (~80%)

**Completed:**
- `tokamak-bench` crate with 12 scenarios
- CLI: `run` / `compare` / `report` / `jit-compare` subcommands
- Regression detection with thresholds (opcode + JIT speedup)
- CI workflow (`pr-tokamak-bench.yaml`) with JIT benchmark jobs
- JIT benchmark infrastructure
- JSON output + markdown report generation
- JIT speedup regression detection with PR comments
- Public dashboard (F-2) — Astro + React islands + Recharts + Tailwind at `dashboard/`, 62 JS/TS + 9 Python tests, `publish-dashboard` CI job

**Remaining:**
- State root differential testing
- Precompile timing export

### Feature #21: Time-Travel Debugger & Autopsy Lab (~98%)

**Completed:**
- `tokamak-debugger` crate with replay engine (E-1)
- LEVM `OpcodeRecorder` hook trait (feature-gated `tokamak-debugger`)
- Per-opcode step recording: opcode, PC, gas, depth, stack top-N, memory size, code address
- Forward/backward/goto navigation API (`ReplayEngine`)
- Stack `peek()` for non-destructive stack inspection
- GDB-style interactive CLI (E-2) — 13 commands: step, step-back, continue, reverse-continue, break, delete, goto, info, stack, list, breakpoints, help, quit
- rustyline REPL with auto-history, `--bytecode <hex>` input mode
- `debug_timeTravel` JSON-RPC endpoint (E-3) — full TX replay over RPC with step windowing
- Serde serialization for all debugger types (StepRecord, ReplayTrace, ReplayConfig)
- Smart Contract Autopsy Lab (E-4) — post-hoc attack analysis:
  - `RemoteVmDatabase`: LEVM `Database` over archive RPC (`reqwest::blocking`), lazy caching
  - `AttackClassifier`: reentrancy, flash loan (3 strategies), price manipulation, access control bypass
  - `FundFlowTracer`: ETH transfers + ERC-20 Transfer events
  - `AutopsyReport`: verdict-first Markdown/JSON, known contract labels (~20 mainnet addresses), storage interpretation, key step timeline, conclusion with storage impact
  - CLI `autopsy` subcommand with `--tx-hash`, `--rpc-url`, `--format`, `--output`
- Autopsy Production Readiness (4-phase hardening):
  - Phase I: RPC timeout (30s) + retry with exponential backoff (3 retries), structured `RpcError` types (6 variants)
  - Phase II: ERC-20 transfer amount decoding from LOG data, price delta estimation via SLOAD comparison, 80+ known contract labels, ABI-based storage slot decoding (keccak256 mappings)
  - Phase III: Bounded caches with FIFO eviction (account 10k, storage 100k), observability metrics (RPC calls/hits/latency), 100k-step stress tests (<5s classification)
  - Phase IV: Confidence scoring on all detected patterns (0.0–1.0 with evidence chains), 10-TX mainnet exploit validation scaffold
- 145 passing tests + 10 ignored mainnet validation scaffolds

**Remaining:**
- Web UI (optional)

### Feature #22: Real-Time Attack Detection — Sentinel (0%)

**Purpose:** Transform the post-hoc Autopsy Lab into a real-time monitoring system. When the ethrex full node processes new blocks, suspicious transactions are automatically analyzed and alerts are generated.

**Planned:**
- H-1: Block execution recording hook (conditional `DebugRecorder` activation during block processing)
- H-2: Lightweight pre-filter (TX screening by call depth / gas / external calls / watchlist)
- H-3: Real-time classification pipeline (async producer-consumer with `AttackClassifier` + `FundFlowTracer`)
- H-4: Alert & notification system (webhook / Slack / log, severity mapping, de-duplication, rate limiting)
- H-5: Sentinel dashboard (live WebSocket feed, historical alert browsing, Grafana metrics export)

**Architecture:** All E-4 analysis components reused directly. New code focuses on triggering, filtering, and alerting.

**Key constraint:** <1% overhead on block processing when sentinel is enabled but TX doesn't match pre-filter. Zero overhead when feature disabled (compile-time gate).

## JIT Benchmark Results

Measured after Volkov R21-R23 fixes (corrected measurement order).
10 runs each, `--profile jit-bench`, Fork::Cancun.

| Scenario | Interpreter | JIT | Speedup |
|----------|------------|-----|---------|
| Fibonacci | 3.55ms | 1.40ms | **2.53x** |
| BubbleSort | 357.69ms | 159.84ms | **2.24x** |
| Factorial | 2.36ms | 1.41ms | **1.67x** |
| ManyHashes | 2.26ms | 1.55ms | **1.46x** |

**Interpreter-only**: Push/MstoreBench/SstoreBench (bytecode > 24KB, graceful fallback via D-2).
**Skipped**: FibonacciRecursive/FactorialRecursive (deep recursive CALL). ERC20* scenarios now benefit from G-4 JIT-to-JIT dispatch.

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Base client | ethrex (LambdaClass) | Rust, LEVM custom EVM, active development |
| JIT backend | revmc (Paradigm) + LLVM 21 | Only functional backend (Cranelift lacks i256) |
| Cache key | `(H256, Fork)` | Fork-specific compiled code |
| Compilation | Background thread (mpsc) | Non-blocking hot path |
| Validation | State-swap dual execution | JIT runs first, interpreter re-runs to verify |
| Memory | Arena allocator (G-1) | Groups compiled fns into arenas; free LLVM resources when all evicted |
