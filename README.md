## Getting started

For instructions on how to get started using ethrex L1 and/or L2, please refer to the ["Getting started" section of the docs](https://docs.ethrex.xyz/getting-started/index.html).

## L1 and L2 support

This client supports running in two different modes:

* **ethrex L1** - As a regular Ethereum execution client
* **ethrex L2** - As a multi-prover ZK-Rollup (supporting SP1, RISC Zero and TEEs), where block execution is proven and the proof sent to an L1 network for verification, thus inheriting the L1's security. Support for based sequencing is currently in the works.

## Tokamak Enhancements

The [Tokamak Network](https://tokamak.network/) fork extends ethrex with advanced tooling for EVM execution analysis and security:

- **Time-Travel Debugger** — GDB-style interactive replay of transactions with forward/backward stepping, breakpoints, and `debug_timeTravel` JSON-RPC endpoint
- **Smart Contract Autopsy Lab** — Post-hack forensic analysis that replays transactions through LEVM, classifies attack patterns (reentrancy, flash loan, price manipulation), and traces fund flows
- **Sentinel Real-Time Detection** — 2-stage pipeline (pre-filter + deep analysis) integrated into block processing, with adaptive ML pipeline, mempool monitoring, auto-pause circuit breaker, and live dashboard
- **Continuous Benchmarking** — Cross-client comparison (ethrex vs Geth/Reth), public dashboard, and CI-integrated regression detection

See [docs/tokamak/README.md](./docs/tokamak/README.md) for full details and [docs/tokamak/STATUS.md](./docs/tokamak/STATUS.md) for current status.

## Why ZK-Native?

ethrex was built from the ground up with zero-knowledge proving in mind. This isn't a feature bolted onto an existing client—it's a core design principle that shapes how we structure execution, state management, and our entire architecture.

**For L1 node operators:**
- Integrations with multiple zkVMs (SP1, RISC Zero, ZisK, OpenVM) allow you to prove Ethereum block execution
- ZK-optimized data structures reduce proving overhead
- Lightweight codebase means less complexity when running alongside provers

**For L2 builders:**
- Multi-prover ZK-Rollup architecture supports SP1, RISC Zero, and TEEs out of the box
- Proof aggregation through [Aligned Layer](https://alignedlayer.com/) integration
- Same execution client for L1 and L2 means consistent behavior and easier debugging

See our [zkVM integrations documentation](https://docs.ethrex.xyz/zkvm-integrations.html) for details on supported proving backends.

## Philosophy

Many long-established clients accumulate bloat over time. This often occurs due to the need to support legacy features for existing users or through attempts to implement overly ambitious software. The result is often complex, difficult-to-maintain, and error-prone systems.

In contrast, our philosophy is rooted in simplicity. We strive to write minimal code, prioritize clarity, and embrace simplicity in design. We believe this approach is the best way to build a client that is both fast and resilient. By adhering to these principles, we will be able to iterate fast and explore next-generation features early, either from the Ethereum roadmap or from innovations from the L2s.

Read more about our engineering philosophy [in this post of our blog](https://blog.lambdaclass.com/lambdas-engineering-philosophy/).

## Design Principles

- Ensure effortless setup and execution across all target environments.
- Be vertically integrated. Have the minimal amount of dependencies.
- Be structured in a way that makes it easy to build on top of it, i.e rollups, vms, etc.
- Have a simple type system. Avoid having generics leaking all over the codebase.
- Have few abstractions. Do not generalize until you absolutely need it. Repeating code two or three times can be fine.
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability over premature optimizations.
- Avoid concurrency split all over the codebase. Concurrency adds complexity. Only use where strictly necessary.
