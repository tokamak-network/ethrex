# Used by the prover when running ZK-DEX end-to-end.
# The proof coordinator assigns "zk-dex" as the guest_program_id
# (via --proof-coordinator.guest-program-id zk-dex), and the
# prover must have it registered here.

# The program used when no specific program_id is requested.
default_program = "zk-dex"

# Only the ZK-DEX program is needed for this configuration.
