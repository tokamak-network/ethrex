# Guest Program Registry Configuration — Tokamak EVM Backend
#
# Used by the prover when running with the Tokamak backend.
# Tokamak-zk-EVM proves EVM execution directly (not a zkVM),
# so only the evm-l2 guest program is supported.
# zk-dex transactions are verified as part of normal EVM execution.

# The program used when no specific program_id is requested.
default_program = "evm-l2"

# Only EVM-L2 is supported with Tokamak backend.
enabled_programs = ["evm-l2"]
