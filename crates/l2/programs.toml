# Guest Program Registry Configuration
#
# Controls which guest programs the prover loads at startup.
# The proof coordinator decides which program_id to assign per batch
# (via ETHREX_GUEST_PROGRAM_ID env var), and the prover must have that
# program registered here to be able to prove it.
#
# Available built-in programs:
#   evm-l2  — Default EVM execution (type_id: 1)
#   zk-dex  — DEX order matching circuits (type_id: 2)
#   tokamon — Gaming state transition circuits (type_id: 3)

# The program used when no specific program_id is requested.
default_program = "evm-l2"

# Only these programs will be registered in the prover.
# Remove entries you don't need to reduce memory usage.
enabled_programs = ["evm-l2", "zk-dex", "tokamon"]
